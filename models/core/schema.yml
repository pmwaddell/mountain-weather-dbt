    description: >
      Weather forecast data from mountain-forecast.com for various mountain peaks at various altitudes.
      Both current weather and forecasted weather is included. Data is organized by the time the forecast
      is said to be issued on the site.
      Each record corresponds to a cell in the unexpanded forecast table from the page of the particular
      mountain on the site, and there are three cells per day: AM, PM, and night. 
      Here, the term forecast is often used loosely to mean any cell in this table, including the first 
      (or leftmost) time, which is assumed to correspond to actual weather events occuring at the mountain. 
      Those cells with times in the future correspond to forecasted weather. 
    columns:
        - name: fact_forecasts_key
          description: >
            Primary key for the table, made from the combination of columns mtn_name, elevation,

          description: >
            This column translates the information in forecast_time_name and the corresponding date into
            a proper timestamp, with AM meaning 7 AM on the listed day, PM meaning 3 PM, and night 
            meaning 11 PM. These times were selected arbitrarily by the author.

  - name: dim_geography
    description:  >
      Information related to the geographic location of each mountain, including the mountain
      range and subrange it is a part of, the latitude and longitude, and the region(s) (i.e., 
      state/province, etc.) it lies within. The region is related by the foreign key
      region_group_key through the bridge_region_group bridge table, since some mountains lie
      on the border between two regions/countries, so this dimension is multivalued.
    columns:
        - name: geography_key
          description: Primary key, derived from mtn_name.
        - name: mtn_name
          description: Name of the mountain.
        - name: region_group_key
          description: >
            References column of the same name in bridge_region_group, to indicate which group of regions 
            (i.e., states/provinces of the relevant country) a particularmountain lies within. Of course 
            some groups have only one region.
        - name: mtn_range

  - name: bridge_region_group
    description: >
      Bridge table that relates the region group to the corresponding regions, and appropriate
      weighting factors. For example, since Kangchenjunga lies on the border between Nepal and 
      India, it is assigned a value of region_group_key in the dim_geography table which corresponds
      to the appropriate regions in both of these countries in this table, with weighting factors 
      of 0.5 each.
    columns:
      - name: region_group_key
        description: Indicates the group of regions a mountain may be in.
