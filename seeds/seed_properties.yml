  - name: dim_geography_seed
    description: >
      Information related to the geographic location of each mountain, including the mountain
      range and subrange it is a part of, the latitude and longitude, and the region(s) (i.e., 
      state/province, etc.) it lies within. The region is related by the foreign key
      region_group_key through the bridge_region_group bridge table, since some mountains lie
      on the border between two regions/countries, so this dimension is multivalued.
  
  - name: bridge_region_group_seed
    description: >
      Bridge table that relates the region group to the corresponding regions, and appropriate
      weighting factors. For example, since Kangchenjunga lies on the border between Nepal and 
      India, it is assigned a value of region_group_key in the dim_geography table which corresponds
      to the appropriate regions in both of these countries in this table, with weighting factors 
      of 0.5 each.

  - name: dim_region_seed
    description: >
      Continent and country where each region (meaning, state/province, subdivision of a 
      country, etc.) is found.

  - name: dim_topography_seed
    description: >
      Information related to the topography of each mountain, such as elevation at the peak,
      prominence and isolation, and where the mountain ranks in these categories in terms of
      all mountains in the world.

  - name: dim_mf_features_seed
    description: >
      Contains information about the "mountain feature" at particular elevations according to 
      mountain-forecast.com. These features are "peak", "mid", and "base", although not every
      mountain has "mid". 

  - name: dim_mountaineering_seed
    description: >
      Information related to mountaineering exploits on each mountain. The data herein proved difficult
      to find for the most part and is highly approximate. Data for the Himalayan peaks was sourced from
      himalayandatabase.com, and is the most up-to-date. Information for some of the other 8000ers was
      taken from 8000ers.com or the Wikipedia article Eight-thousander, specfifically the table
      Estimated sample death rates for the 14 eight-thousanders. Note that those numbers are over 10 years
      out of date at this point, and many more ascents have likely occured since this time, likely 
      comparable to the total ascents recorded in the table. Denali information was taken from the 
      National Park Service's Annual Mountaineering Summaries. Numbers for Mont Blanc, Vinson Massif,
      Flattop and Mount Whitney were estimated based on google searches, and are probably not very 
      reliable. Apparently there have actually been no deaths on Mount Vinson, or at least very few, so 
      I left the number at 0. Where I couldn't even really estimate the numbers I left the field blank.
