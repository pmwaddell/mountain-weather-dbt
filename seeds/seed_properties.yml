  - name: dim_geography
    description: >
      Information related to the geographic location of each mountain, including the mountain
      range and subrange it is a part of, the latitude and longitude, and the region(s) (i.e., 
      state/province, etc.) it lies within. The region is related by the foreign key
      region_group_key through the bridge_region_group bridge table, since some mountains lie
      on the border between two regions/countries, so this dimension is multivalued.
  
  - name: bridge_region_group
    description: >
      Bridge table that relates the region group to the corresponding regions, and appropriate
      weighting factors. For example, since Kangchenjunga lies on the border between Nepal and 
      India, it is assigned a value of region_group_key in the dim_geography table which corresponds
      to the appropriate regions in both of these countries in this table, with weighting factors 
      of 0.5 each.

  - name: dim_region
    description: >
      Continent and country where each region (meaning, state/province, subdivision of a 
      country, etc.) is found.
